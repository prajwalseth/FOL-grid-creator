Create a Flower of Life grid in seconds. Just input the latitude and longtiude of the center point, radius, and number of points you want the grid to be. 

The output text file can be directly imported into Google Earth for easy plotting.

If you would only like to keep a few points from the grid, then rename those points and click on the folder and click "Sort A-Z". Then you can easily select the chosen points and move them into a new folder.
